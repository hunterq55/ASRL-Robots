# ASRL-Robots

This repository will host all working code used to control the ROME mobile manipulator platform in the Astrodyanamics and Space Robotics Lab at UCF.

The goal of this repository is to host all files needed for simulation of each system separately and together, as well as the required hardware connection needed to control the hardware platform using MATLAB and the Arduino Support Package.
